      # govcms/scaffold-tooling is a composer package which is somewhat
      # coupled with GovCMS/Lagoon. So this is an integration test for
      # to replicate how composer builds govcms (eg. 'composer create-project ...').
      # First we build a govcms docker environment (CLI and DB only)
      # without installing Drupal.
      # Then inside the CLI container we modify the composer.json to reference
      # our new code and use this code to install and run Drupal, thus testing
      # the scaffold.
